# Breast Cell Classification Project

## Description
This project involves predicting the class of each breast cell (benign/malignant) after exposure to carbon nanoparticles. The objective is to determine whether nanoparticle exposure affects the recognition of tumor tissue. Participants are tasked with developing one or more prediction models using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The performance metric to optimize is Accuracy. 

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is Accuracy, which is calculated as the percentage of correctly classified instances with respect to the total evaluated instances.

Accuracy = (True Positive + True Negative) / Evaluated Instances

## Dataset Description
The dataset provided by the DICMAPI research group includes multichannel images of breast cell samples captured under different imaging modalities. Each sample consists of multiple cells, and each acquisition is represented as a distinct folder containing images of individual cells in .npy format. The training set comprises 40 acquisitions, while the test set comprises 10 acquisitions without separate folders.

## Results
The solution achieved an accuracy of 97.6%.
